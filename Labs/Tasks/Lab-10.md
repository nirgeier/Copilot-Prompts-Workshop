# Lab 10 - Advanced Instructions Hands-On

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

## 01. Set Up the Folder Structure

- Create a folder named `.github/instructions/` in the root of your project.
- This folder will contain our custom instruction files.

## 02. Create the Instruction File
- Inside the `.github/instructions/` folder, create a new file named `script.instructions.md`.
- This file will contain the specific instructions for files in the `script` directory.

## 03. Add Scoped Instructions

- Open the `.github/instructions/script.instructions.md` file and add the following frontmatter at the top:
    ```markdown
    ---
    applyTo: "script/**/*.sh"
    ---
    # Custom Instructions for Bash Scripts
    - All scripts must start with `#!/bin/bash` as the shebang.
    - Before any logic, check if a `.env` file exists in the same directory as the script
    - if `.env` exists, load it with `source ".env"`.
    - Define color variables for output (e.g., green for info, red for errors, yellow for warnings, blue for debug).
    - Implement and use the following logging functions for all output:
        - `log_info` for informational messages (green)
        - `log_error` for error messages (red, output to stderr)
        - `log_debug` for debug messages (blue, only print if a DEBUG variable is set)
        - `log_warn` for warnings (yellow)
    - Always quote variables in bash to prevent word splitting and globbing.
    - Use `set -euo pipefail` at the top of the script for safer error handling.
    - Use functions for logical grouping of code; avoid long, unstructured scripts.
    - Add comments to explain non-obvious logic.
    - Use `$(...)` for command substitution, not backticks.
    - Prefer `[[ ... ]]` for conditionals over `[ ... ]`.
    - Scripts should exit with a non-zero status on error.
    - Avoid hardcoding paths; use variables and check for file existence.
    - Use `trap` to handle cleanup on exit if the script creates temporary files or resources.
    - All scripts must be POSIX-compliant unless Bash-specific features are required.
    - Add a usage/help function if the script takes arguments.
    ```
- Save the file.        

## 04. Instructions in Action

- Now, when you will create bash scripts in the `script` directory, GitHub Copilot will follow the custom instructions defined in `script.instructions.md`.
- Test this by creating a new bash script in the `script` directory and observing how Copilot generates code based on the specified instructions.
- Use the following prompt in Copilot Chat to generate a new bash script:

    !!! explorer "Prompt to use in Copilot Chat"
        * Create a bash script that print the current date and time
        * The bash script should be in the `script` directory.

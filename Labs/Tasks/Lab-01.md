# Lab 01 - Setup Hands-On

## 01 - Create Workshop Directory

- Open your VsCode and create new directory named `Copilot-Prompts-Workshop`.
- Open the created directory in VsCode.

## 02 - Create Virtual Environment

* The virtual environment will help us manage dependencies for the workshop.
* Run the following command in your terminal to create a virtual environment named `venv`

  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  ```

## 03 - Activate the venv

=== "Windows (cmd)"
    ```cmd
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"
    ```powershell
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

=== "macOS / Linux (bash/zsh)"
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

=== "Git Bash (Windows)"
    ```bash
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

## 04 - Create Project Structure

- Create a new directory named `calculator` in your workshop folder.

- Inside the `calculator` directory, create the following file:
  * `calculator.py` - This will be the main module for our calculator functions.

    - Inside `calculator.py` and add the following starter code:
        ```python
        # calculator.py
        def add(x, y):
            """Add two numbers."""
            return x + y
        ```
- Your project structure should look like this:
  ```
  Copilot-Prompts-Workshop/
  ├── calculator/
  │   └── calculator.py
  ```  

## 05 - Install Required Extensions

* install the following Python Packages:

    ```bash
    # Create the .venv as explaind above if you haven't already.
    source .venv/bin/activate   # or the appropriate command for your OS
    pip install uv

    # Will be used in later labs
    uv pip install pytest    
    ```

## 06 - Optional .github folders

* (Optional) Create a `.github` folder in the root of your project directory.
* The `.github` folder is a special directory used to store configuration files and templates that are specific to GitHub's platform features.

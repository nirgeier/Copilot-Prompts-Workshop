# Lab 09 - Custom Instructions Hands-On

#### Generating Custom Instructions

* Instead of writing the instructions from scratch, let's use `GitHub Copilot` to generate a draft for us based on our project context.

### 01: Create from prompt

* Use the following prompt to generate a comprehensive instruction file.

    !!! debug "Prompting Copilot"
        ```text
        @workspace I want to create a .github/copilot-instructions.md file for this repository. 
        Please analyze the current codebase (Python, Calculator project) 
        and generate a comprehensive set of custom instructions. 
        
        Include sections for:
          01. Code Style (PEP 8, type hints)
          02. Testing (pytest)
          03. Documentation (Google style docstrings)
          04. Architecture (Class-based, modular)
          05. Behavior (Concise, professional)
          06. Error Handling (ValueError for invalid inputs)
          07. Library Preferences (standard library only)
          08. Performance (efficient algorithms)
          09. Git Conventions (Conventional Commits)
          10. Security (input validation)
          11. Use "double quotes" for strings.
    
        Format the instructions in Markdown and save it in the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file.
        ```

* Copy the generated content into `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

### 02: Create from scratch

  1. Create a new folder named `.github` in the root of your workspace if it doesn't exist.
  2. Create a file named `copilot-instructions.md` inside it.
  3. Copy the content generated by Copilot into this file.
  4. Review and refine the instructions.

### 03 - Checklist

* Ensure your `copilot-instructions.md` covers the major parts. Use this checklist to verify:
* Validating Your Instructions

    - [ ] **Role Definition**: Does it define Copilot's persona?
    - [ ] **Code Style**: Are naming conventions and formatting rules clear?
    - [ ] **Type Safety**: Are type hints explicitly required?
    - [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Is the testing framework and style specified?
    - [ ] **Documentation**: Are docstring formats (e.g., Google, NumPy) defined?
    - [ ] **Error Handling**: Are there instructions on how to handle exceptions?
    - [ ] **Library Preferences**: Does it mention specific libraries to use or avoid?

## 05 - Testing the Instructions

* Now that you've created the file, let's test if Copilot is respecting it.

  1.  Open `calculator/calculator.py`.
  2.  Write in the custom instructions: (1st line of the file)
      ```text
      Reply in spanish
      ```
  3.  Ask Copilot to anything
  4.  Verify that the response is in Spanish.

# Lab 02 - Inline Suggestions Hands-On

## 01 - Single Inline Suggestion

* In this step, we will use `GitHub Copilot` to help us add a new function to our calculator.

- Open `calculator/calculator.py` in VS Code.
- Use `GitHub Copilot` to help you add a new function `subtract(x, y)` that subtracts two numbers.

    !!! debug "Using GitHub Copilot to add subtract function"
        - Place your cursor below the `add` function.
        - Type a comment describing the function you want to create:
            ```python
            # Add function to subtract two numbers
            ```
        - Wait for `GitHub Copilot` to suggest the implementation of the `subtract` function.
        - Accept the suggestion by pressing `Tab` or `Enter`.


- After adding the function, your `calculator.py` should look like this:
    ```python
    # calculator.py
    def add(x, y):
        """Add two numbers."""
        return x + y

    def subtract(x, y):
        """Subtract two numbers."""
        return x - y
    ```

## 02 - Multiple Inline Suggestion

* Now, Based upon what we used above, add 2 more methods for multiply and divide.
  
* Use `GitHub Copilot` to help you add a new function `multiply(x, y)` that multiplies two numbers.
* Use `GitHub Copilot` to help you add a new function `divide(x, y)` that divides two numbers.
* **This time we will add both functions together.**

    !!! debug "Using GitHub Copilot to add multiply and divide functions"
        * Place your cursor below the `subtract` function.
        * Type a comment describing the function you want to create:
            ```python
            # Add function to multiply two numbers
            # Add function to divide two numbers
            ```
        * Wait for `GitHub Copilot` to suggest the implementation of the `multiply` and `divide` functions.
        * Accept the suggestion by pressing `Tab` or `Enter`.
  
* After adding the functions, your `calculator.py` should look like this:
    ```python
    # calculator.py

    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    # Add subtract function
    def subtract(a, b):
        return a - b
        
    # Add function to multiply two numbers
    # Add function to divide two numbers
    def multiply(a, b):
        return a * b

    def divide(a, b):
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
        return a / b
    ```
    
* If the code does not match, for example the divide by zero check is missing, we will handle it in the next lab.  
* Congratulations! 
    * You have successfully used GitHub Copilot to add multiple functions to your calculator using inline suggestions.

## 03 - Contextual Suggestions

* GitHub Copilot understands the context of your code. Since we are building a calculator with arithmetic operations, it can anticipate other common mathematical functions.

* Let's add a power function.
* Place your cursor at the end of the file.
* Start typing `def power` and pause.

    !!! debug "Adding power function"
        Type:
            ```python
            def power
            ```
        * Copilot will likely suggest:
            ```python
            def power(a, b):
                return a ** b
            ```
        * Accept the suggestion.

* Now, let's try to add a square root function.
* Start typing `def sq`.

    !!! debug "Adding square root function"
        * Type:
            ```python
            def sq
            ```
        * Copilot should suggest a square root implementation. 
        * Note that it might suggest importing `math` or using `** 0.5`.
        * If it suggests `math.sqrt`, make sure to add `import math` at the top of the file if it's not there, or let Copilot handle it.
